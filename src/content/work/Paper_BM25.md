### Paper Focus:
Our study, titled **"Long Documents Formater for Information Retrieval (LDF-IR): a BM25 Enhancer,"** introduces a preprocessing pipeline designed to enhance the BM25 algorithm. The aim is to improve document retrieval performance by leveraging semantic insights from pre-trained text embedders, selectively duplicating and omitting words to optimize relevance and rarity. The study demonstrated notable success, achieving higher scores than SPLADE and baseline BM25 on the NF Corpus dataset.
