> What is this all about ?

One of my first projects was to develop a Scrabble game in the terminal using C#. This project not only provided an enjoyable challenge but also significantly enhanced my object-oriented programming skills. Building the game from scratch involved creating and managing various objects, which deepened my understanding of C# and object-oriented principles. It was a rewarding experience that allowed me to apply my programming knowledge in a fun and practical way.
