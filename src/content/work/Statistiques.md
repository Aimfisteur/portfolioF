## Subject

> What is this all about ?

During my second year of the integrated preparatory class at ESILV in La Défense, Paris, I undertook a project in collaboration with Richard Goudelin, Sébastien Mugnier, and Eve Pineau in April 2022. The study aimed to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the well-being of Indian students. We utilized a dataset to identify trends, relationships, and correlations among various factors. This endeavor sought to answer the question: What were the factors influencing the well-being of Indian students during the lockdown? The project aimed to deepen our statistical skills, using the R software to conduct this relevant analysis in a global context marked by the COVID-19 pandemic.
