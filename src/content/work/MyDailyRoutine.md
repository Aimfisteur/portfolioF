> What is this all about ?

I am someone who values organization, and to enhance my productivity, I love planning my day in advance. Sometimes, a task may span beyond a single day, necessitating its repetition on the following day. Additionally, I find many planning applications needlessly complicated and cluttered with advertisements. This led me to create MydailyRoutine, an application designed to boost productivity through efficient planning.

The features are simple yet effective: creating tasks, setting them to repeat, automatic removal upon completion at midnight, and the ability to prioritize and organize tasks.

I have developed an ergonomic and sleek dark-themed design with figma.
